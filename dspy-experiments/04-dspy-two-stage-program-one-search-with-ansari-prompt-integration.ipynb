And be mindful of Allah ˹O wives of the Prophet!˺ Surely Allah is a Witness over all things.

Do not enter the homes of the Prophet without permission ˹and if invited˺ for a meal, do not ˹come too early and˺ linger until the meal is ready. But if you are invited, then enter ˹on time˺. Once you have eaten, then go on your way, and do not stay for casual talk. Such behaviour is truly annoying to the Prophet, yet he is too shy to ask you to leave. But Allah is never shy of the truth. And when you ˹believers˺ ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and theirs. And it is not right for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever marry his wives after him.

The search query is composed in the Arabic language to optimize the retrieval of relevant search results. If a direct answer can be provided without searching, it is returned at this stage.
