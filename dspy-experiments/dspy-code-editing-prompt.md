b. Edit the forward method to accomodate getting results from all sources,
c. Merge the instructions of the answer from stage 1 with the instructions for answer from stage 2 to make stage 2 answer comprehensive of all requirements.
</things_to_do>
Parts of the program to be adapted:
   - Stage1OutputResult fields' description
   - GenerateStage1Output doc string
   - Stage2InputData fields' description
   - GenerateStage2FinalAnswer doc string and fields' description
