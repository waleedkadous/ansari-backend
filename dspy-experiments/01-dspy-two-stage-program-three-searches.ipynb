    "This two-stage program answers Islam-related questions by leveraging a large language model and searching through authoritative Islamic sources. In the first stage, the program accepts a question, determines the language, and generates relevant search queries for Hadith, Quran, and the Encyclopedia of Islamic Jurisprudence (Mawsuah), if necessary. If a direct answer can be provided without searching, it is returned at this stage. Otherwise, the search queries are executed, and relevant results are gathered. In the second stage, the original question, its language, and the search results are used to generate a factually based final answer. The answer is provided in the same language as the input question.\n",
